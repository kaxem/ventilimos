            I am Christopher Lederer, a dedicated professional who turned his hobby into a
            fulfilling career. In 1986, I got my first personal computer, and by 1990, I was building
            my own from scrap parts. This early interest developed into a strong background in
            system administration and hardware.

            From 1992 to 1999, I provided telecommunications and fax solutions for various
            businesses, coupling this practical experience with formal education as I pursued a
            egree in Medicine from 1992 to 1998. Studying medicine gave me a deep
            understanding of accountability, clear communication, and expectation management,
            values that I still uphold in my professional approach.

            In 1999, I embarked on a career in technology management and leadership. I've held
            various executive roles, in notable companies specialising in executive management,
            organisational structuring, process management, strategic and operational technology
            management, and team development.

            Throughout my journey, I've come to understand that success in the tech industry
            goes beyond just technical knowledge. It involves clear communication, efficient
            systems, realistic expectations, and a deep understanding of the unique culture of
            each organisation. My experience working across different countries and continents
            has cultivated a culturally adept approach that allows me to adapt to diverse work
            environments effectively.

            These insights and experiences led me to establish Ventilimos Consulting. Here, I share
            my strategies with businesses and individuals, guiding them through the complexities
            of scaling and leadership transition.
